//! This module defines the protocol of the trip service
//! 
//! The trip plugin solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic 
//! (farthest-insertion algorithm) for 10 or more waypoints and uses brute force for 
//! less than 10 waypoints. The returned path does not have to be the fastest path. 
//! As TSP is NP-hard it only returns an approximation. Note that all input coordinates 
//! have to be connected for the trip service to work.
//! 
//! It is possible to explicitely set the start or end coordinate of the trip. 
//! When source is set to first, the first coordinate is used as start coordinate of the 
//! trip in the output. When destination is set to last, the last coordinate will be used 
//! as destination of the trip in the returned output. If you specify any, any of the 
//! coordinates can be used as the first or last coordinate in the output.
//! 
//! However, if source=any&destination=any the returned round-trip will still start at 
//! the first input coordinate by default.
//! 
//! Currently, not all combinations of roundtrip, source and destination are supported. 
//! Right now, the following combinations are possible:
//! roundtrip | source  | destination | supported
//! ----------+---------+-------------+-----------
//! true      | first   | last        |    yes
//! true      | first   | any         |    yes
//! true      | any     | last        |    yes
//! true      | any     | any         |    yes
//! false     | first   | last        |    yes
//! false     | first   | any         |    no
//! false     | any     | last        |    no
//! false     | any     | any         |    no
